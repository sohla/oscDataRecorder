    - [x] remove data from DeviceViewConttoller (Data needs to be prototyped not this controller)
    - [x] DeviceController : OSC client, send data, pass data
    - [x] CameraViewController : handle OSC data, embed data into video
- [ ] multiple device implementation
- [ ] receive and transmitter stored config. 
- [ ] need to refactor recording, OSC server etc.
- [ ] alternative passing eg. output cvs file
- [ ] clear all unused code, facial code etc.
- [ ] refactor VideoRecorder and VidePlayer out from ViewControlles
