- select and playback video and output OSC data 

## Dependancies
- OSCKit
- SwiftyJSON


### TODO

- [ ] fininish refactor of all data
    - [ ] remove data from DeviceViewConttoller (Data needs to be prototyped not this controller)
    - [ ] DeviceController : OSC client, send data, pass data
    - [ ] CameraViewController : handle OSC data, embed data into video
- [ ] receive and transmitter stored config. 
- [ ] need to refactor recording, OSC server etc.
- [ ] alternative passing eg. output cvs file
- [ ] clear all unused code, facial code etc.
- [ ] refactor VideoRecorder and VidePlayer out from ViewControlles 


### ideas
